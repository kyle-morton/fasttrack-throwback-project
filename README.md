App that gives users ability to book a flight from a programatically generated list of flights. These are created by a background service. The frontend app will also be able to find connecting flights in case a direct flight from O/D isn't possible. 

Worked on a similar app back in 2014 in a training course I took. Wanted to take another crack at it almost a decade later.
